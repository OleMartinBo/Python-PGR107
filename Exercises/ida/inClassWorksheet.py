1. 
Write a function named reverseLookup that finds all the keys in a dictionary
that map to a specific value. The function will take the dictionary 
and the value to search for as its only parameters. 
It will return a (possibly empty) list of keys from the dictionary that map to the provided value.
Include a main program that demonstrates the reverseLookup function as part of your solution to this exercise.
Your program should create a dictionary and then show that the reverseLookup function works correctly when it
returns multiple keys, a single key, and no keys.
